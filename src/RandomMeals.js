Heat a tablespoon of oil in the frying pan and fry the meat over a high heat. Do this in three batches so that you donu2019t overcrowd the pan, transferring the meat to a large flameproof casserole dish once it is browned all over. Add extra oil if the pan seems dry.rnIn the same pan, add another tablespoon of oil and cook the shallots for 4-5 minutes, then add the garlic and fry for 30 seconds. Add the bacon and fry until slightly browned. Transfer the onion and bacon mixture to the casserole dish and add the herbs.rnPreheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.rnPour the stout into the frying pan and bring to the boil, stirring to lift any stuck-on browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Pour the stout over the beef in the casserole dish and add the stock. Cover the casserole and place it in the oven for 1u00bd-2 hours, or until the beef is tender and the sauce is reduced.rnSkim off any surface fat, taste and add salt and pepper if necessary, then stir in the cornflour paste. Put the casserole dish on the hob u2013 donu2019t forget that it will be hot u2013 and simmer for 1-2 minutes, stirring, until thickened. Leave to cool.rnIncrease the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6. To make the pastry, put the flour and salt in a very large bowl. Grate the butter and stir it into the flour in three batches. Gradually add 325ml/11fl oz cold water u2013 you may not need it all u2013 and stir with a round-bladed knife until the mixture just comes together. Knead the pastry lightly into a ball on a lightly floured surface and set aside 250g/9oz for the pie lid.rnRoll the rest of the pastry out until about 2cm/u00bein larger than the dish youu2019re using. Line the dish with the pastry then pile in the filling, tucking the oysters in as well. Brush the edge of the pastry with beaten egg.rnRoll the remaining pastry until slightly larger than your dish and gently lift over the filling, pressing the edges firmly to seal, then trim with a sharp knife. Brush with beaten egg to glaze. Put the dish on a baking tray and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the pastry is golden-brown and the filling is bubbling.","strMealThumb":"https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/wrssvt1511556563.jpg","strTags":"Pie","strYoutube":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONX74yP6JnI","strIngredient1":"Beef","strIngredient2":"Olive Oil","strIngredient3":"Shallots","strIngredient4":"Garlic","strIngredient5":"Bacon","strIngredient6":"Thyme","strIngredient7":"Bay Leaf","strIngredient8":"Stout","strIngredient9":"Beef Stock","strIngredient10":"Corn Flour","strIngredient11":"Oysters","strIngredient12":"Plain Flour","strIngredient13":"Salt","strIngredient14":"Butter","strIngredient15":"Eggs","strIngredient16":"","strIngredient17":"","strIngredient18":"","strIngredient19":"","strIngredient20":"","strMeasure1":"900g","strMeasure2":"3 tbs","strMeasure3":"3","strMeasure4":"2 cloves minced","strMeasure5":"125g","strMeasure6":"1 tbs chopped","strMeasure7":"2","strMeasure8":"330ml","strMeasure9":"400ml","strMeasure10":"2 tbs","strMeasure11":"8","strMeasure12":"400g","strMeasure13":"pinch","strMeasure14":"250g","strMeasure15":"To Glaze","strMeasure16":"","strMeasure17":"","strMeasure18":"","strMeasure19":"","strMeasure20":"","strSource":"https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/beef_and_oyster_pie_65230","strImageSource":null,"strCreativeCommonsConfirmed":null,"dateModified":null},
